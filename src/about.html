    <p>
        System Source has a computer museum displaying technology from the inception of computing. Founders Bob Roswell
        and Maury Weinstein opened ComputerLand, a predecessor to System Source, in 1981. Rapid advances in technology
        in the early 1980’s made some ComputerLand inventory obsolete before it could be sold. Bob and Maury’s old
        ComputerLand store on Redwood Street had a bank vault in the basement, so they filled it with vintage tech.
        Today, Bob exhibits the extensive collection in a museum space within System Source, an IT systems integrator in
        Hunt Valley, Maryland. Bob enjoys leading tour groups, sharing his memories of vintage computers and learning
        from his guests’ experiences.
